# Database Operation Rules

## Prisma Migrations & Schema Changes
- **ALWAYS** prefer using `pnpm prisma db push` for schema updates during development.
- **NEVER** run `pnpm prisma migrate dev` or `prisma migrate reset` without checking strictly if it will cause data loss.
- **NEVER** use `scripts/reset-db-local-safe.sh` unless the user has **explicitly** requested a full database wipe/reset/start-over knowing that data will be lost.
- If a migration command suggests a database reset, **STOP** and ask the user for confirmation or switch to `db push`.

## General Safety
- When in doubt about data persistence, ask the user.
